# CSC_560
My first repository on GitHub
From here there will be many updates pursuing my CSC560 Classwork. 
This is a test for creating a new branch. I'm liking it 

Here is Assingment 1.1 Self Evaluation

**Self Evaluation**
How long did you spend on this assignment?
**I  used approximately 2 hours to complete this assignment, ensuring thoroughness and attention to detail. I focused on the task, aiming to meet the requirements and produce a satisfactory outcome.**

Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?
**Based on my efforts in the assignment, I feel like I earned an A because I devoted my energy and time to completing it and did it within the deadline. Throughout the process, I thoroughly familiarized myself with the GitHub tutorial, successfully creating a new repository and ensuring its accessibility to the public. By actively engaging with the material, I comprehensively understood GitHub's functionalities, expanding my knowledge and skills. Moreover, I successfully implemented the server file we discussed in class, effectively applying RESTful principles. Overall, I feel confident in my performance and the valuable insights I acquired, making an A grade a fitting assessment of my efforts.**

Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
**I would say that I earned an A based on my solution. I created a new repository for the server we created in this unit and have attached the link to my repository.**

Provide a summary of what doesn't work in your solution, along with an explanation of how you attempted to solve the problem and where you feel you struggled.
**Based on my week's solution assessment, I faced no challenges because my solution worked.I followed the following procedures when I felt like I was struggling to complete the assignment; I followed the GitHub tutorial as I tried to understand the basic step of creating the repository, which I will then submit as my assignment. I also used Youtube videos to help me learn the new commands of uploading and connecting GitHub with my local repository of the assignment 
Because I followed the instructions and could put them into practice, I had no trouble with any of the processes involved in setting up a new repository or sending a link to my public GitHub repository. I finished all the assignments by following the tutorial's instructions.**




**4.1 Self Evaluation**
**How much time did you spend on this assignment?**
 I spent three full days working on this assignment.
**Based on your effort, what letter grade would you say you earned?** 
Considering the effort and time I put into understanding and completing the tutorial, I deserve an "A" grade. Learning these technologies as a beginner is challenging, and I am proud of my dedication.
Based on your solution, what letter grade would you say you earned?
 I completed both tutorial parts, created the required unit tests, and integrated my MongoDB collection into a RESTful API server. Thus, based on my solution, I would assign myself an "A." The application is functioning as expected, and I have met the objectives of the tutorial.
**What parts of the tutorial were the most challenging?**
 Being new to the MEAN stack, I found understanding the connection between MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js challenging. Data modeling in MongoDB and creating unit tests were complex tasks. Additionally, managing asynchronous operations and callbacks in Node.js was particularly tough.
**What did you learn from this assignment?** 
Despite the challenges, I have learned a lot from this assignment. I better understand how data flows and is manipulated within the MEAN architecture. I have also improved my skills in creating unit tests and managing asynchronous operations in Node.js.
I aim to apply what I have learned from this experience for future assignments. I will spend more time on difficult areas and focus on understanding the underlying concepts better. I will also try to practice more with real-life scenarios to become more comfortable with these technologies.
**What are your next steps in improving your understanding of the MEAN stack?**
 I plan to continue learning by working on more MEAN stack projects. I believe practical knowledge application is crucial to understanding complex subjects. I will also seek help from online resources and the developer community when encountering difficulties.
 
 **4.2 Self Evaluation**
**How long did I spend on this assignment?**
I spent three days on this assignment, dedicating several hours each day to complete the required tasks.
**Based on my effort, what letter grade would I say I earned?**
Considering the effort I put in, including the time spent researching, coding, and troubleshooting, I would say I deserve an A grade for my commitment and dedication to completing the assignment.
**Based on my solution, what letter grade would I say I earned?** 
Regarding the solution I developed, I believe it deserves an A grade. It successfully fulfills the requirements of creating an Angular-based front end that enables adding/updating/deleting players and performing the specified queries.
**What doesn't work in my solution, and how did I attempt to solve the problem? Where did I struggle?** 
While the overall solution is functional, there is a specific area that needs improvement—error handling. During the implementation, I encountered challenges in handling errors and exceptions gracefully. For instance, when submitting invalid input, the application might not provide clear feedback to the user. I added basic try-catch blocks and implemented some error-handling mechanisms to address this. However, there may still be cases where errors are not adequately handled or communicated to the user, leading to an inconsistent user experience.

**4.3 Final Project Self-evaluation**
**How long did I spend on this assignment?**
I dedicated around four days to completing this assignment, investing time in designing the data set, developing the API using Node.js and Express, and creating the user interface with Angular.
**Based on my effort, what letter grade would I say I earned?** 
Considering the time and effort I put into this assignment, I deserve an A for my commitment and dedication to completing the task.
**Based on my solution, what letter grade would I say I earned?** 
Regarding the solution I developed, I believe it deserves an A grade. I successfully created a MongoDB data set related to one of my hobbies, implemented a well-designed API with five endpoints (including two for retrieving data), and created a functional user interface using Angular.
**What doesn't work in my solution, and how did I attempt to solve the problem? Where did I struggle?** 
While the overall solution is functional, there is one area that requires improvement—user authentication and authorization. I struggled with implementing a secure authentication system to protect the API endpoints and ensure only authorized users can interact with the data. Although I attempted to address this issue by implementing basic authentication mechanisms, there is still room for enhancement to ensure a more robust and secure solution.
